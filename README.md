# imdb_reviews


This project uses the **IMDB Reviews dataset** to build a sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as **positive** or **negative**. It also demonstrates **NLP preprocessing** and **basic explainable AI methods** for interpreting model predictions.

## Dataset
- **Name:** IMDB Reviews  
- **Size:** 50,000 movie reviews (25k train, 25k test)  
- **Labels:** 0 = Negative, 1 = Positive  

## Project Features
- Load and preprocess text data (tokenization, padding, cleaning)  
- Train models such as BERT or LSTM for sentiment classification  
- Evaluate model performance using **accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix**  
- Apply **Explainable AI methods** (LIME, SHAP, or attention visualization) to understand model predictions
